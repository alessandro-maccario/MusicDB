# Music Database

This is an experiment to improve my knowledge of MySQL by creating a Music Database from scratch.
The *music_db.sql* contains all the code to create the database, all the tables and inserting all the rows.
The database contains (WIP) the following tables:
- Artists
- Albums
- Songs
